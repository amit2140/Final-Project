Final Project Report - Netflix

Introduction:
In this analysis, I explored a comprehensive Netflix dataset to identify trends, patterns, and comparisons that could inform strategic decision-making and elevate the viewer experience. By leveraging data analytics methods, I aimed to gain meaningful insights into genre popularity, content additions over time, ratings across countries, and average durations of movies and TV shows. Through this deep dive into the Netflix catalog, the goal was to extract actionable findings that can help enhance viewer satisfaction and support business growth for the streaming platform.
Methodology:
A range of techniques was employed to extract valuable insights from the Netflix dataset. The process began with thorough data preprocessing, including the handling of missing values, elimination of irrelevant columns, narrowing the scope to our target countries, and reformatting data fields to ensure consistency and accuracy. After preparing the dataset, I utilized various data visualization methods to effectively communicate findings. Charts such as scatter plots, line graphs, stacked bar charts, and pie charts were essential in transforming complex data into digestible insights. These visualizations played a critical role in interpreting patterns and clearly conveying the results.
Major Findings:
Most Popular Genre for Top 10 Countries (Across Movies & TV Shows):
This analysis focused on identifying the most popular genres across both Movies and TV Shows in the top 10 countries. To do this, I separated the dataset into distinct data frames for Movies and TV Shows, then filtered for the most popular genres within each category. Among TV Shows, "International TV Shows" emerged as the most favored genre, accounting for 22.6% of the data. For Movies, "Dramas" led with 21.4%. Notably, Drama also ranked as the second most common genre for TV Shows (tied with TV Comedy at 12.7%), while "International Movies" took second place among films with 19.7%. These findings reveal that Dramas and International-themed content are consistently favored across both categories.
Most Popular Genres by Release Year (Across Movies & TV Shows):
This segment aimed to discover the most popular genres per release year for both Movies and TV Shows, and to compare trends across categories. Using aggregation, I calculated yearly counts of each genre, enabling a clear view of genre popularity over time. From 2000 onward, Dramas, Comedies, International content, and Documentaries/Docuseries consistently ranked as the top four genres in both categories. Romance and Kids/Family genres were also frequently represented. The growing volume of titles added each year further supports that these core genres maintain steady demand across newly added content, regardless of original release dates.
Movies Added Per Year for Top 10 Countries (Across Movies & TV Shows):
This analysis examined the rate of content additions by country. The United States led with the highest volume of TV shows added annually. Starting in 2014, there was a noticeable increase in shows from countries outside the U.S., with Canada joining the mix, followed by broader international contributions by 2017. Between 2020 and 2021, a noticeable decline in new titles occurred across major countries—such as the U.S., Japan, the U.K., and South Korea—coinciding with pandemic-related production halts. In the film category, the U.S. also dominated, with India following as the second-highest contributor. Most other countries added fewer than 100 films per year. The decline in content additions beginning in 2019 likely reflects global disruptions in media production due to COVID-19.
Rating Percentages for Top 10 Countries (Across Movies & TV Shows):
The objective here was to break down rating distributions across the top 10 countries. I created separate dataframes for movies and TV ratings, then visualized the data using stacked bar graphs. The U.S. led movie ratings at 55.19%, followed by India at 23.94%, with India’s content heavily skewed toward the TV-14 rating (14.10% of total data). U.S. movie ratings were more evenly distributed, but TV-MA (16.43%) and R (11.80%) were the most common. Interestingly, the R rating was rare or absent in most other countries, with South Korea and Japan reporting zero, and the U.K. showing only 0.88%. TV ratings were more evenly distributed. The U.S. still led with 47.86%, but the U.K. (13.41%), Japan (10.57%), and South Korea (9.95%) also had strong representation. Notably, Japan and South Korea—despite low movie contributions—showed strong participation in TV ratings, particularly in the TV-14 category. The U.K. and U.S. showed strength in both TV-MA and TV-14 ratings, highlighting their balanced focus on diverse age demographics.
Average Number of Show Seasons / Movie Duration for Top 10 Countries (Across Movies & TV Shows):
This section explored the number and duration of movies and TV shows by country, along with an analysis of genre distribution. Of the 8,806 titles analyzed, 6,131 were films and 2,676 were TV shows. The top 10 content-producing countries included the U.S., India, U.K., Canada, Spain, Japan, South Korea, France, Australia, and China. The U.S. had the highest total number of titles and TV show seasons (760), followed by India with nearly 1,000 total titles. Movie genres most commonly included Dramas, International, Documentaries, and Stand-Up Comedy, while top TV genres were International TV Shows, Dramas, Kids' TV, and Reality TV. The genre distribution in films was more concentrated, with Dramas and International movies reaching peaks of 362 titles, while Kids' TV led the TV category with 220 titles. In terms of co-productions, collaborations between the U.K., U.S., and Japan resulted in over 200 films, while Denmark, Singapore, Canada, and the U.S. averaged 13 seasons for joint TV productions.
Conclusion / Recommendations:
The analysis revealed several valuable insights. The U.S. and India are the most prolific contributors to Netflix's catalog, with overlapping dominant genres including Drama, International, Comedy, Documentaries, Romance, and Kids/Family. Ratings reflect the cultural learnings of each country, with India favoring TV-14 and the U.S. contributing most R-rated content. To refine Netflix’s strategic content development, the platform should continue focusing on these popular genres and top-producing countries. Improving data integrity—such as correcting column inconsistencies and clearly distinguishing between TV seasons and movie durations—will be vital for accurate future analyses. This analysis serves as a foundation for broader comparative research. Future studies could explore data from other streaming platforms like Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Disney+, which could reveal content gaps or new market opportunities. Additional deep dives into the original dataset could also yield insights into underrepresented genres, prominent directors or cast members, or release year trends. These findings could ultimately guide Netflix in optimizing its content strategy based on region, genre, and audience preferences.
